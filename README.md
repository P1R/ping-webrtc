# webrtc ipfs ping
the goal is to understand webrtc str0m implementation, do some testing codes and
after have the base to migrate from webrtc-rs to str0m on libp2p.

## ToDo
- [x] Fix issues on the example code
- [ ] Build test on ipfs ping over webrtc
- [ ] build test on ipfs ping over webrtc-browers
- [ ] understand Strom and verify implementation in libp2p
- [ ] rebuild examples but with libp2p

## Development procedure
1. Research sources and references from [Issue](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/3659)
2. Read the [webRTC](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/webrtc/webrtc.md) specification 
3. Research and test for libp2p webRTC-rs implementation and proof of concept
4. Research and test for st0rm impelmentation and test it https://github.com/algesten/str0m/issues/166
